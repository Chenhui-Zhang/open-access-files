Hi [[First Name]],

Seeing [[Company]]'s dedication to [[Service]] for [[Application]] applications, I'm excited to share how CADDi Drawer’s AI Drawing Similarity Search, developed from our custom fabrication experiences, aligns perfectly with your needs. 

Have you considered if there might be untapped opportunities or inconsistent pricing due to pressured quotation processes for RFQs and varying levels of knowledge among quoting members?

Our software scales up quoting capacity and accelerates sales response times by automatically identifying similar historical drawings with associated production cost data. This approach has enabled our [[Sheet metal or Machining]] fabricator customers to double quoting productivity and achieve substantial growth in sales.

[[Personalized Message]] We are keen to explore how we can help strengthen your sales team and contribute to the ongoing growth and success of [[Company]].

Would you be open to a brief discussion about how our solution could optimize your processes?

Best regards,
Yushiro
